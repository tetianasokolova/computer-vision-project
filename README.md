# Animals-10 Image Classification Project

This project focuses on classifying images from the **Animals-10 dataset**, which contains 10 animal classes. The goal is to build and train a deep learning model to accurately classify these images.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of images of 10 animals:
- Dog
- Horse
- Elephant
- Butterfly
- Chicken
- Cat
- Cow
- Sheep
- Spider
- Squirrel

## Setup Instructions
1. **Environment Setup**:
   - I will be using Google Colab for this project.
   - Ensure GPU acceleration is enabled.

2. **Dataset Download**:
   - Download the Animals-10 dataset.
   - Upload the dataset to Google Colab or connect your Google Drive.

3. **Data Preparation**:
   - Explore the dataset structure.
   - Split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets.
   - Apply data augmentation and normalization.
   - Create DataLoader objects for batch processing.

4. **Visualization**:
   - Visualize sample images from each class.
   - Plot a histogram to show the distribution of images across classes.
